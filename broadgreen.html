                <h4>Driving in Broad Green</h4>

With its convenient access to Croydon’s town center, Broad Green is a sought-after area that blends suburban calm with urban amenities.</p>

        <h4 class="tiptitle" style="text-align:center;">Broad Green Instructor's Tips</h4>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Be Mindful of School Zones:</strong>
                Slow down and stay alert near schools in Broad Green, especially during busy drop-off and pick-up times when children may be crossing the road.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigate Residential Roads with Care:</strong>
                Broad Green has several narrow residential streets, often lined with parked cars. Maintaining a safe distance from the curb and parked vehicles is essential.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Watch for Pedestrians:</strong>
                Busy retail areas attract many pedestrians, so be extra cautious in these spots, especially around crosswalks and bus stops.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adjust for Weather Conditions:</strong>
                Rain and occasional frost in winter can affect driving. Use appropriate lights and increase your following distance in wet or icy conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice Parking Skills:</strong>
                Parking can be limited near retail zones, so practicing parallel and bay parking will help you navigate tighter spots with ease.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Know Your Routes:</strong>
                Familiarize yourself with Broad Green’s roads to avoid congestion during peak hours, especially on routes near major shops and schools.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Roundabouts Safely:</strong>
                Broad Green has several small roundabouts. Always yield to traffic already on the roundabout, signal clearly when exiting, and watch for other drivers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Aware of Cyclists:</strong>
                Cyclists are common on Broad Green’s roads. Give them plenty of space when passing, especially on narrow streets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Utilize GPS for Navigation:</strong>
                GPS can help navigate Broad Green’s residential and retail streets, but always combine it with situational awareness in busy areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Calm During Congestion:</strong>
                Traffic can build up around shopping zones and during rush hours. Practicing patience and maintaining a safe following distance is key.
            </li>
        </ul>
