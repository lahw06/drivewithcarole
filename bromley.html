        <h4 class="tiptitle" style="text-align:center;">Bromley Instructor's Tips</h4>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Be Mindful of School Zones:</strong>
                Reduce speed and stay vigilant near schools in Bromley, especially during busy drop-off and pick-up times when children may cross the road unexpectedly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigate Residential Roads Carefully:</strong>
                Bromley’s residential areas can feature narrow streets with parked cars on both sides. Keeping a safe distance from the curb and parked vehicles is crucial for safe driving.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Watch for Pedestrians:</strong>
                Bromley’s bustling High Street and retail areas attract many pedestrians, so be extra cautious around crosswalks, bus stops, and shopping zones.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adjust for Weather Conditions:</strong>
                Rain and occasional frost during winter can impact driving. Use appropriate lights, increase your following distance, and be mindful of wet or icy conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice Parking Skills:</strong>
                Parking near Bromley’s retail hubs like The Glades can be challenging, so practicing parallel and bay parking will help you handle tight spaces more easily.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Know Your Routes:</strong>
                Familiarizing yourself with Bromley’s main roads, especially around popular spots, can help avoid congestion during peak hours and ease navigation through busy areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Roundabouts Safely:</strong>
                Bromley has several roundabouts, particularly around high-traffic zones. Always yield to traffic already on the roundabout, signal clearly, and stay alert for other drivers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Aware of Cyclists:</strong>
                Cyclists are common on Bromley’s roads, especially around scenic routes and shopping areas. Be sure to give them ample space when passing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Utilize GPS for Navigation:</strong>
                GPS can be helpful for navigating Bromley’s mix of main roads and side streets, but always combine it with situational awareness, especially in commercial areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Calm During Congestion:</strong>
                Bromley’s high street and retail areas can become congested, particularly during weekends. Practicing patience and maintaining a safe following distance are key to safe driving.

                <h4>Driving in Addington</h4>
                <p class="beleft" style="text-align: left;">Addington, a charming village in the London Borough of Croydon, is nestled in a historic area rich with heritage sites and surrounded by scenic residential roads. While it retains a village atmosphere, Addington sees a steady flow of local traffic, especially near landmarks like Addington Palace and St. Mary the Blessed Virgin Church. During school hours and weekends, the roads near primary schools and community centers are particularly busy, requiring drivers to stay alert.

Like much of South England, Addington enjoys mild weather, though the winter months bring rain and occasional frost, presenting unique challenges for drivers during these colder times.</p>
