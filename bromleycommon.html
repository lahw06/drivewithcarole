    <div class="info-section2" style="align-items: center; left:500px;">
        <h4 class="tiptitle" style="text-align:center;">Bromley Common Instructor's Tips</h4>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Be Mindful of School Zones:</strong>
                Reduce speed and stay alert near schools, particularly during peak times. Children may cross the road unexpectedly, especially near parks and residential areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigate Residential Roads with Care:</strong>
                Bromley Common’s residential streets can be narrow and often lined with parked cars. Maintaining a safe distance from the curb and other vehicles is essential.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Watch for Pedestrians:</strong>
                The area’s shopping and dining spots, especially around Chatterton Village, attract many pedestrians. Stay cautious around crosswalks and bus stops.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adjust for Weather Conditions:</strong>
                Rain and occasional frost in winter can make driving challenging. Use lights as needed and increase your following distance in wet or icy conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice Parking Skills:</strong>
                Parking around Bromley Common’s retail and leisure spots can be limited, so practicing parallel and bay parking will help you feel comfortable handling tighter spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Know Your Routes:</strong>
                Familiarizing yourself with Bromley Common’s main and side roads, especially near busy areas, can help you navigate effectively and avoid peak-time congestion.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Roundabouts Safely:</strong>
                There are several roundabouts around Bromley Common. Always yield to traffic on the roundabout, signal clearly, and stay aware of other drivers’ movements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Aware of Cyclists:</strong>
                Cyclists are common on Bromley Common’s roads, particularly around scenic routes. Give them plenty of space when passing, especially on narrow roads.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Utilize GPS for Navigation:</strong>
                GPS can help navigate the area’s mix of residential and main roads, but always stay aware of your surroundings, particularly in high-traffic zones.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Calm During Congestion:</strong>
                Bromley Common’s main roads can become congested, especially near retail and residential hubs. Practicing patience and maintaining a safe following distance is essential for safe driving.
            </li>
        </ul>
