                <h4>Driving in Norbury</h4>
                <p class="beleft" style="text-align: left;">
                    Norbury is a district in south London, situated within the London Borough of Croydon and sharing the SW16 postcode with its neighboring area, Streatham.

The High Street serves as a vibrant center of local commerce, where independent shops, cafes, and a variety of businesses provide a lively atmosphere for the community. Over the years, Norbury has transformed from its origins as a rural, pastoral landscape to a multicultural residential area, characterized by its sense of community and strong connections to surrounding areas like Crystal Palace, Croydon, and Streatham.

        <h4 class="tiptitle" style="text-align:center;">Norbury Instructor's Tips</h4>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Mind the High Street:</strong> Norbury High Street is known for its shops and cafes, often bustling with pedestrians and cyclists. Keep a watchful eye and be ready to give way as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adjust for Tram Crossings:</strong> If traveling towards Croydon, prepare for interactions with trams. Understand the signs and signals that guide safe tram crossings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare for Busy Intersections:</strong> Major junctions such as those around Norbury Station and the London Road can be congested, especially during peak hours. Practicing lane discipline here is essential.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Be Cautious Near Schools:</strong> With several schools in the area, be mindful of reduced speed limits and active school zones, especially during drop-off and pick-up times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Utilize Nearby Parks for Parking Practice:</strong> Norbury Park and its surroundings offer good practice spaces for parallel and bay parking, away from the busy main road.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice Roundabout Navigation:</strong> Norbury has several small roundabouts that require careful entry and exit. Maintain a steady speed, and yield to traffic already on the roundabout.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Local Knowledge:</strong> Familiarize yourself with shortcuts and less busy side roads to avoid congestion, particularly if heading towards Croydon or Streatham during rush hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mind Speed Limits:</strong> Norbury’s residential streets often have varied speed limits; observing these helps ensure safe driving in the neighborhood.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Vigilant for Cyclists:</strong> Norbury’s popularity with cyclists means it's important to check blind spots and provide ample space, particularly on narrow roads.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Plan for Zone 3 Public Transport Connections:</strong> Norbury Station offers links to central London, so expect higher pedestrian foot traffic nearby and plan accordingly.
            </li>
        </ul>
