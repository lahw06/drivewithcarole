        <h4 class="tiptitle" style="text-align:center;">Petts Wood Instructor's Tips</h4>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Alert Near Schools:</strong>
                Petts Wood has several schools, so be extra mindful of speed limits and pedestrian crossings, particularly during school start and end times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Petts Wood Station Responsibly:</strong>
                The station area can get busy, especially at peak hours. Exercise caution around pedestrians and parked vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice Parking Around Shopping Areas:</strong>
                Parking near the shopping district can be limited. Practice parallel and bay parking in quieter areas if you’re new to driving here.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Follow Speed Limits in Residential Zones:</strong>
                Many streets in Petts Wood are narrow and residential. Drive slowly, respecting speed limits and giving pedestrians ample space.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Be Prepared for Cyclists and Walkers:</strong>
                Petts Wood’s green spaces attract walkers and cyclists. Be cautious and allow extra space when overtaking them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigate the Area’s Roundabouts Safely:</strong>
                Petts Wood features small roundabouts; ensure you signal clearly, yield to traffic on the right, and proceed cautiously.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Check for Parking Restrictions:</strong>
                Some areas have specific parking restrictions, especially near shops and public spaces. Make sure to follow signs to avoid fines.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use GPS Navigation Mindfully:</strong>
                Petts Wood has a mix of winding streets and main roads. GPS can be helpful, but stay alert to surrounding traffic and pedestrians.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adjust for Weather and Road Conditions:</strong>
                The area's narrow, tree-lined streets can become slippery in rain or frost. Slow down and increase following distance when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Anticipate Traffic Near Jubilee Country Park:</strong>
                The park attracts visitors, especially on weekends. Watch for parked cars, increased pedestrian traffic, and slowed traffic near the park entrance.
            </li>
        </ul>
