                <h4>Driving in Sundridge </h4>
                <p class="beleft" style="text-align: left;">
                    Sundridge is a picturesque village located within the civil parish of Sundridge with Ide Hill, in the Sevenoaks district of Kent, England. Nestled along the A25, east of Westerham, it lies within the scenic Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Metropolitan Green Belt. This historic village, approximately 21 miles south of London, features a 12th-century Anglican church dedicated to St Mary, which stands as a Grade I listed building. Sundridge’s historic charm is also reflected in Radnor House, a Palladian mansion built in 1728, which has served as a private home, convent, school, and now as a wedding venue.
                </p>
                
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <a class="changea" style="text-align: left;" href="caroleadi.html">Carole</a>, a dedicated driving instructor in Sundridge, provides personalized driving lessons that cover the village’s diverse settings, from scenic rural lanes to busier sections along the A25. Her instruction includes practice with navigating country roads, maintaining control on winding routes, and honing skills for parking in tight spots around historical areas. With Carole's guidance, learners build confidence to manage both rural and urban driving scenarios effectively.

        <h4 class="tiptitle" style="text-align:center;">Sundridge Instructor's Tips</h4>
        <ul class="tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Alert on Country Roads:</strong> Sundridge’s rural lanes can be narrow and winding. Drive slowly, stay cautious around bends, and be ready to yield to oncoming vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mind Pedestrians Near Historic Sites:</strong> The village attracts visitors to its historical areas, so be especially cautious when driving near Radnor House or St Mary’s Church.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Caution on the A25:</strong> The A25 road can experience heavy traffic, particularly around junctions and intersections. Be sure to signal well in advance and keep a safe following distance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare for Limited Visibility:</strong> Sundridge’s countryside roads may have low visibility at night. Use high beams appropriately, but switch back to low beams when approaching other vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Respect Parking Zones:</strong> Parking near historic sites or conservation areas in Sundridge can be limited. Practice parallel parking and stay mindful of posted parking regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Watch for Cyclists and Walkers:</strong> The scenic countryside attracts cyclists and walkers. Give them plenty of space, especially on narrow or winding roads.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adapt to Weather Changes:</strong> Roads around Sundridge can become slippery with rain or frost, especially in winter. Reduce speed and increase your following distance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Utilize GPS Navigation Sparingly:</strong> GPS can help navigate Sundridge’s mix of rural and main roads, but keep an eye on road signs and markings, particularly near historical areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stay Calm in Congested Areas:</strong> Traffic around popular village spots may increase, especially during weekends or events. Practice patience and maintain safe distances.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Roundabouts Properly:</strong> Several routes on the A25 involve roundabouts; always yield to traffic within the roundabout and signal clearly when exiting.
            </li>
        </ul>
